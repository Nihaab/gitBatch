My Interview Experience with Persistent Systems – Programmer (Dev) 5.2

A few weeks ago, I interviewed for the Persistent Systems – Programmer (Dev) 5.2 role, and I’m sharing my complete experience to help others preparing for similar opportunities.

There were two technical rounds, both focused heavily on Core Java, Collections, Streams, Concurrency, Spring Boot, and JPA.

🧩 ROUND 1 – Core Java, Collections, Streams, Concurrency
Java & JVM

1. Can you name a few new services/features introduced in Java 24?
2. How does Java memory management work internally?

OOP & Language Features
3. Have you heard about co-variant return types?
4. HashMap & Concurrency
5. What is the main purpose of HashMap?
6. What is the contract between hashCode() and equals()?
7. What enhancement was made in HashMap after Java 1.8?
8. After which point does HashMap convert a bucket into a Red-Black Tree?

ConcurrentHashMap
9. Why do we need ConcurrentHashMap if HashMap already exists?
10. How does locking work in ConcurrentHashMap?
11. What is the default bucket size?
12. With bucket size 16, how many read/write operations can happen simultaneously?

Java Streams – Coding Questions
13. Sort a list of Employees by highest salary (fields: id, name, dept, salary).
14. Given "This is Java Programming", reverse each word using Streams.
15. From an array, fetch the first 3 odd numbers using Streams.
16. Fetch only the second odd number using Streams.

Agile
17. Do you work in Agile? What’s your sprint duration?

💡 Takeaway
This interview deeply tested my understanding of Java internals, Streams, concurrent data structures, Spring Boot fundamentals, and JPA mappings.
 It gave me a clear idea of where to improve—especially around concurrency, async execution, and repository-layer design.

I’m grateful for the opportunity and appreciate the time and effort the interviewers invested in the process.

 They asked to explain:
each annotation
lazy vs eager
mapping structure
copy constructor logic
caching strategy

Interviewer: "You have 2 minutes. Please brief 𝗛𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗠𝗮𝗽 𝘃𝘀 𝗛𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗧𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘃𝘀 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗛𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗠𝗮𝗽".

My answer: Challenge accepted, Let's go!

Choosing the right Map implementation in Java is crucial for performance and thread safety. 

Below is a detailed comparison:
🔹 𝗛𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗧𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲
𝗦𝘆𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱: Yes, all methods are synchronized (thread-safe but slow).
𝗡𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝗞𝗲𝘆𝘀/𝗩𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲𝘀: Does not allow null keys or values.
𝗟𝗲𝗴𝗮𝗰𝘆 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀: Introduced in JDK 1.0, later replaced by better alternatives.
𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲: Slower due to method-level synchronization.
𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴: Uses a linked list to store multiple entries in the same bucket.

🔹 𝗛𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗠𝗮𝗽
𝗦𝘆𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱: No, not thread-safe.
𝗡𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝗞𝗲𝘆𝘀/𝗩𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲𝘀: Allows one null key and multiple null values.
𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲: Faster than HashTable as it is not synchronized.
𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴: Uses a linked list (before Java 8) and a balanced tree (after Java 8 for large buckets).
𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲: Best for single-threaded applications.

🔹 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗛𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗠𝗮𝗽
𝗦𝘆𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱: Yes, but more efficient than HashTable.
𝗡𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝗞𝗲𝘆𝘀/𝗩𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲𝘀: Does not allow null keys or values.
𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲: Faster than HashTable due to fine-grained synchronization.
𝗧𝗵𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱-𝗦𝗮𝗳𝗲𝘁𝘆: Uses segment-based locking (before Java 8) and CAS (Compare-And-Swap) operations (after Java 8) for concurrent reads and writes.
𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴: Uses a linked list (before Java 8) and a balanced tree (after Java 8 for large buckets).
𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲: Best for multi-threaded applications where concurrent access is required.

🔹 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗵𝗼𝗼𝘀𝗲?
For single-threaded applications → Use HashMap (best performance).
For multi-threaded applications → Use ConcurrentHashMap instead of HashTable (better concurrency, avoids performance bottlenecks).
